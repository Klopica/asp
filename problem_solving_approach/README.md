# Problem solving approach / patterns
## PREREQUISITS
It is strongly recomended to first complete section 1: Big O Notation before working through this section.

## INTRODUCTION
This and the next section deal with problem solving strategies, patterns, game plans

### Objectives
* Define what an algorithm is
* Devise a plan to solve algorithms
* Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequesncy counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer

### What is an algorithm?
A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
Almost everything you do in programming involves some sort of algorithm.
It's the foundation for being a succesful problem solving developer

### How do you improve?
1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns

## Understanding The Problem
Note: many of strategies in this course are adapted from George Polya, whose book "How To Solve It" is a great resource for anyone who wants to become a better problem solver.

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's ok, it's still worth considering the question at this early stage)
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

### Task to exercise questions above: Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

* Check index.js for this example

## Concrete Examples
* Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem better
* Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should.

### Explore examples
* Start with Simple Examples
* Progress to more complex examples
* Explore Examples with empty inputs
* Explore examples with Invalid inputs

## Break It Down
* Write down steps of the problem. This does not have to be pseudocode or valid syntax. Only comments that represent steps that need to be done to come to solution.
  * Explicitly write out the steps you need to take
    * This forces you to think about the code you'll write bedore you write it, and helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g. language syntax.) as well


## Solve Or Simplify
### Simplify
* Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
* Temporarily ingnore that difficulty
* Write a simplified solution
* Then incorporate that difficulty back in

## Look Back and Refactor
It' realy important to try and improve your code!

### Refactoring questions
* Can you check the result?
* Can you derive the result differently?
* Can you understand it at a glance?
* Can you use the result or method for some other solution?
* Can you improve the performance of your solution?
* Can you think of other ways to refactor?
* How have other people solved this problem?
